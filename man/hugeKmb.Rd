\title{Internal wrapper function to implement rank-based correlation to huge.mb function in "huge" package.}
\usage{
hugeKmb(data, lambda, type = "trunc", sym = "or", verbose = TRUE,
  verboseR = TRUE, tol = 1e-06)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{n by p matrix data. usually through pulsar, data will receive subsamples.}

\item{lambda}{a vector of lambda values}

\item{type}{a type of variables. "trunc" is default.}

\item{sym}{"or" is the symmetrizing rule of the output graphs. If sym = "and", the edge between node i and node j is selected ONLY when both node i and node j are selected as neighbors for each other. If sym = "or", the edge is selected when either node i or node j is selected as the neighbor for each other. The default value is "or". (refer to huge manual)}

\item{verbose}{If \code{verbose = FALSE}, tracing information printing for HUGE (High-dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation) with a specified method (currently "mb" is only available) is disabled. The default value is TRUE.}

\item{verboseR}{If \code{verboseR = FALSE}, printing information whetehr nearPD is used or not is disabled. The defalut value is TRUE.}

\item{tol}{Desired accuracy when calculating the solution of bridge function in estimateR function.}
}
\value{
\code{hugeKmb} returns a data.frame containing
\itemize{
     \item{beta: }
     \item{path: }{a list of}
     \item{df: }
}
