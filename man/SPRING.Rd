}
\arguments{
\item{data}{n by p matrix of microbiome count data, either quantitative or compositional counts. Each row represents each subject/sample and each column represents each OTU (operational taxonomic unit).}

\item{quantitative}{default is FALSE, which means input "data" is compositional data, which will be normalized using mclr transformation within a function. If TRUE, it means "quantitative" counts are input and no normalization will be applied.}

\item{method}{graph estimation methods. Currently, only "mb" method is available.}

\item{lambda.min.ratio}{default is 0.01}

\item{nlambda}{default is 20.}

\item{lambdaseq}{a sequence of decreasing positive numbers to control the regularization. The default sequence has 20 values generated to be equally spaced on a logarithmic scale from 0.6 to 0.006. Users can specify a sequence to override the default sequence. If user specify as "data-specific", then the lambda sequence will be generated using estimated rank-based correlation matrix from data.}

\item{seed}{the seed for subsampling.}

\item{ncores}{number of cores to use for subsampling. The default is 1.}

\item{thresh}{threshold for StARS selection criterion. 0.1 is recommended (default). The smaller threshold returns sparser graph.}

\item{subsample.ratio}{0.8 is default. The recommended values are 10*sqrt(n)/n for n > 144 or 0.8 otherwise.}

\item{rep.num}{the repetition number of subsampling for StARS eddge stability selection. The default value is 20.}

\item{Rtol}{Desired accuracy when calculating the solution of bridge function in estimateR function.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{verbose = FALSE}, tracing information printing for HUGE (High-dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation) with a specified method (currently "mb" is only available) is disabled. The default value is TRUE.}

\item{verboseR}{If \code{verboseR = FALSE}, printing information whetehr nearPD is used or not when calculating rank-based correlation matrices is disabled. The defalut value is FALSE.}

\item{Rmethod}{The calculation method of latent correlation. Either "original" method or "approx". If \code{Rmethod = "approx"}, multilinear approximation method is used, which is much faster than the original method. If \code{Rmethod = "original"}, optimization of the bridge inverse function is used. The default is "approx".}

\value{
\code{SPRING} returns a data.frame containing
\itemize{
      \item{output: }{Output results of \code{pulsar::pulsar} based on StARS criterion. It contains:}
              \itemize{
                       \item{merge: } a list of length \code{nlambda} and each element of list contains a matrix of edge selection probability. Each lambda value, this edge selection probability is calculated across \code{rep.num}.
                       \item{summary: } the summary statistic over \code{rep.num} graphs at each value of lambda
                       \item{opt.index: } index (along the path) of optimal lambda selected by the criterion at the desired threshold. Will return \eqn{0} if no optimum is found or \code{NULL} if selection for the criterion is not implemented.
                       \item{criterion: } we use StARS for our stability criterion.
              }
      \item{fit: }{Output results of \code{pulsar::refit} function. It contains:}
      \itemize{
              \item{est: } a data frame containing
              \itemize{
                       \item{beta: } Estimates of beta coefficient matrices (of size p by p) by "mb" method on the whole data at each of whole lambda sequence value.
                       \item{path: } Estimates of precision matrix (of size p by p) on the whole data at each of whole lambda sequence value.

              \item{refit: } final estimates of precision matrix (of size p by p).
